# ERC777 and ERC1363: Problems and Solutions

## What Problems Do ERC777 and ERC1363 Solve?

### ERC777

* __Token Hooks__: ERC20 tokens lack a notification system for token transfers, making interactions with smart contracts less efficient. ERC777 introduces token hooks, enabling contracts to respond to token movements, which is crucial for creating interactive and responsive systems.

* __Simplified Token Handling__: ERC20's two-step process (approve and transferFrom) for token transfers to contracts can be cumbersome. ERC777 streamlines this with a single send function, incorporating pre-transfer and post-transfer hooks for added flexibility.

*  __Enhanced Interoperability__: ERC777 supports advanced token handling, improving the interaction between tokens and decentralized applications (dApps), which enhances the overall interoperability within the Ethereum ecosystem.

* __Backward Compatibility with ERC20__: ERC777 is designed to be backward compatible with ERC20, allowing it to integrate smoothly with existing ERC20 infrastructure and tools.

### ERC1363

* __One-step Transactions__: ERC1363 combines the approval and transfer steps into a single transaction, reducing complexity and the possibility of errors, making transactions more efficient.

* __Direct Payment Execution__: ERC1363 allows contracts to execute functions immediately upon receiving tokens, enabling real-time payment processing and execution of contract functions without additional transactions.

* __Improved User Experience__: The streamlined process enhances user interaction with decentralized applications, making it easier to pay for services using tokens and reducing the steps required to complete a transaction.

### Why Was ERC1363 Introduced?

ERC1363 was introduced to address the limitations of ERC20 in terms of usability and transaction efficiency. Specifically:

* __Simplifying Payments__: ERC1363 aims to streamline token transfers and contract interactions by combining them into a single transaction, making it more straightforward for users to pay for services or products.

* __Enhanced Usability__: By providing a more user-friendly interface for token interactions, ERC1363 makes it easier for users to engage with decentralized applications, improving the overall user experience.

* __Real-time Contract Interaction__: The standard allows smart contracts to respond immediately upon receiving tokens, facilitating dynamic and responsive dApp interactions, which is particularly useful for applications like subscriptions, pay-per-use models, and automated marketplaces.

### What Issues Are There with ERC777?

* __Complexity__: ERC777's advanced features, such as token hooks and flexible token handling, increase the complexity of the standard. Developers need to thoroughly understand these features and their implications to implement them correctly.

* __Security Risks__: The introduction of token hooks can lead to potential security vulnerabilities. Improper implementation of these hooks can result in issues like reentrancy attacks, requiring developers to conduct rigorous security audits.

* __Higher Gas Costs__: The additional functionality provided by ERC777 can lead to higher gas costs compared to simpler standards like ERC20. This could affect the feasibility of using ERC777 for certain applications where gas efficiency is a critical factor.
